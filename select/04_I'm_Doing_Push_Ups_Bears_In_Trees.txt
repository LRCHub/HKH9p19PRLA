I'm not just gonna lie here and wait for the ambulance
I'm doing push ups, I'm doing push ups
my marriage is falling apart
it's not your fault but i
just thought i should let you know
you could take advantage of me
it's not that hard
i wrote it out in detail
just check your texts
your first love's not gonna walk you home
you got sick on your coat
then you called her and told her it's over
now you're as hollow as you'd always said you be
screaming hold my hand but please don't touch me
and then you pulled out an engagement ring
and the canary choked in my throat
and I was coughing up feathers all December
but we never made a memory to remember
some things just weren't made to make sense
some things weren't meant to be represented
we talk about it in the gaps, in the silence
the posts we delete and the captions we edit
do you wanna,
do you wanna go, go
we'll cause a scene at the wedding
write awful words on the confetti
