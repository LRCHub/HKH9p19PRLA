Fire in da callums house
Woo
Let's get this
You get me, Jamie

I'l do 20,000 pushups every morning
I'll walk with books on my head
I'll learn the correct cutlery to use
I won't sleep, I'll read dictionaries instead

I will consume every piece of art
Watch every film the day they come out
I will read every poem and book ever written
And know exactly what they're about

I will down whole bottles of cod liver oil
Take all of my meds on time
I will use the longest word in the world in a song
And I will make it rhyme

I will learn to ride my bike with no handlebars
I will get home every night
And not get hit by cars
I will make my bed every morning
I will clean the house every night
I will become so much more than what I am, and I'll be alright
I'll be alright
